Uses GBA Music Wave SDK by Sergej Kravcenko, which supports playback of simple 4 channel mod files. Found a newer version via the Wayback Machine here:

...but this newer version doesn't work with with the code yet, so haven't upgraded yet.


#### How to fix "X supports interworking but Y does not" warning messages?

This has several causes. Using objcopy to convert binary to object format is one source. Use the following on the file that has problems. This will flip the mthumb-interwork bit in the file to remove this warning:

    interflip -mthumb-interwork file.o
    


DONE
-redo death animation
-use alpha blend to fade blocks in at the start of each level
-fix capsule collision with paddle
-delete all capsule sprites when clearing a level, and at death.
-try to make capsule code faster (or sync the display better)
-fix multiple capsule bug (happens when set to more than 1)
-fix logo scroll code to use a fixed float factor and not a timer
-fix wall vs paddle collision, now that the paddle h-vel factor was changed
-add actual powerup functionality
   -Multiball
   -slow/fast ball - using trig
   -grow / shink powerups

MAYBE
-change paddle and ball to use smaller size images (images... not sprites)
-use select button to cycle through songs
-use look-up table for TextToBG ascii conversion
-credits screen?
-get rid of white flicker between screen transitions (if possible without doing fades)

TODO
-add actual powerup functionality
   -cannon powerup
      -collisions of bullets vs blocks
      -destroy all bullets when die, and when they go offscreen
      -make cannons alpha blend, then disapear when die
-fix timing / countdown issue
-get sound working
-set correct volumes for each sound
-add more levels
-add more backgrounds for levels
-add more music
-set correct volumes for each mod file
-speeds may need to be adjusted for hardware vs emu.

gba Background Memory layout
------------------------------
CharBaseBlocks begin at 0x6000000 = contain 8 blocks at 2048 bytes each = 16K or 16384 bytes
each of these blocks are also shared and correspond to a ScreenBaseBlock

Max memory location is 0x6000000 + 65535 bytes (64K total background memory)
