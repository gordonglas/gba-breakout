1. ARM SDT compiler

Player main code should be placed in Internal RAM (0x03000000). This is done by changing
code ro segment to data rw segment for player code. If you link player with your project 
make sure that data rw segment is set to 0x03000000. I have not yet found solution if
project data segment is set to 0x02000000. (Please send me an email if you know how to
set different rw segment for different .o files)

2. GCC compiler

All player code is placed in .data segment and aslo should be placed in Internal RAM. But
in GCC you can easily set .data segment to 0x03000000, while you are using different data
segment for your variables. Simply make sure that player code is in Internal RAM.
