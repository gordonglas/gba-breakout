# Blockout for GameBoy Advance

Note this is an early version that still has some debugging enabled (on-screen output) and is unfinished and buggy. I wrote this code in 2002'ish and just recently found it on a burned DVD in 2019. If I have time, I'll try to clean it up, fix bugs, add more levels and add more info here.

### How to build:

I have included everything you should need to build it on Windows NT based operating systems.
After cloning the repo, unzip all files within \bin\devkitadv\ so they end up in c:\devkitadv\

Run \src\make.bat to build main.gba

Run main.gba in your emulator.
