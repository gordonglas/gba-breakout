Note that when creating these smaller images from a single one,
they must all share the same 256 color palette.
To do this in paint.net, you load the full pcx file,
select the inner image portion using the rectangle selector,
then CROP it -> save as -> in pcx save dialog,
check "Use original palette".
DO NOT copy/paste to a new image,
as that will lose the palette info.

Use dovoto's pcx2sprite.exe to generate the c header file.
